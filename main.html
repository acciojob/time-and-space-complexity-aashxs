	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run 
    as a function of the length of its input. It's a crucial concept in computer science and 
    algorithm design because it helps us understand how efficient algorithms.</p>
    <p>
        
          An algorithm with <b>space complexity</b>of O(n) means that the amount of memory 
         it uses scales linearly with the size of the input. This indicates
         that as the input size increases, the algorithm requires 
         a proportional amount of additional memory.
